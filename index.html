	<p align="center"> Tourism is Hawaii's largest industry. Over the years, it has brought a lot of money to Hawaii and tourists get to enjoy the islands. However,
		tourism is growing to be a large problem. Tourists have been jeopardizing the lands, disturbing locals, terrorizing the wildlife, and have just been outright 
		disrespecting customs.
	
		The Pono Points Game is developed to combat the negative impacts tourism has had on Hawaii's lands. By educating tourists on what's right and wrong amongst the
		islands, how to treat the lands with respect, and rewarding them for doing so, the push for change is achievable. </p>
